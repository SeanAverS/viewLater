        <h1>Privacy Policy for viewLater</h1>
        <p>The viewLater Chrome extension is designed to help users manage their personal bookmarks. This extension
            operates entirely locally within your browser.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The viewLater extension does NOT collect, transmit, or share any personal data from your browser to any
                external servers or third parties.</li>
            <li>All link titles, URLs, notes, and group information are stored exclusively within your local Chrome
                browser storage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Usage:</h2>
        <p>The data you save is used solely to provide the core functionality of the viewLater extension (saving, displaying, searching, editing, and deleting your bookmarks).</p><h2>Data Access, Modification, and Deletion:</h2><p>Users have full control over their data. You can view, edit, and delete your saved links directly within the viewLater extension popup at any time. All data is stored locally and can be removed by uninstalling the extension or by clearing your browser's local storage data for this extension.</p>

        <h2>Data Security:</h2>
        <p>Since data is stored locally, its security relies on the security of your browser and operating system.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy:</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
